Honestly, I don't think there's been a single day this month where that app hasn't been mentioned by either the radio Hello all! I've been jotting down all my drops running through the Elemental Ruins and I've got a bit a data to share. How I decided to handle this is by running through all the difficulties (Beginner, Standard, and Expert) 10 times each every day and adding up all the gathered materials, making it about 50 run through each difficulty. Here's how I've gone about sorting everything: Tier 1 Orbs : Flame Orb, Water Orb, Wind Orb, Light Orb, Shadow Orb Tier 1 Materials : Fiend's I mean it’s obvious now when you think about it. Eddy (the leader of the group) was obviously on some type of stimulant (Coke/Meth) because he would always come up with these master plans and talk fast as hell to people trying to get what he wanted. Edd (double d) was the chiller and smarter one of the group which makes me think he was a major stoner and took psychedelics on the regular. Ed was your stereotypical bartard/alcoholic. He was dumb, slow and lethargic most of the time. (My friend. Hello everyone. My son loves grilling and like all kids he is obsessed with YouTube. So he has asked me to help him make videos about grilling. He is very proud and to be honest I am too. If you have a few minutes and want to see what he has to say we both would appreciate it. -He gets very excited watching the views go up and as his mom I love to see his excitement. Thanks! Have a splendid evening. https://youtu.be/8S6guNAZ82Y Follow up video: https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/bb23up/w. how can i quit the love of the my life: JUUL? i smoked for years but quit over five years ago. i caved and started juuling six mos back due to inordianate stress. problem is, i loove juuling so much more than smoking--the cyborgian aesthetics, the pods which catch the light like jewels, its scentless vapor of convenient and discrete nothingness. this is my last remaining vice aside from being a cunt and occasional THC, but at this point, my juuling has descended into a costly shame spiral cycle. # Sheet here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1VWDABThA1-UFSFgDzXWa-KGbUTV2LLRPdCKBVCkss2g/edit#gid=923032971) Costs Shadow Fiend needs: 1167 currency If farming maiden: 2334 stamina If farming princess: 3504 stamina active v0 player gains: \~5k stamina over the course of 9 days and 19 hours so it should be free The sheet has a stamina calculator and lets you keep track of your currencies to make sure you are not giving Debbie COMPLETED! :D Hey, so I love the table in the DMG, p 142, about adding flavor to your magic items by picking special features for them, especially the 'Who Created It' section. I was trying to see if anyone expanded the table, but I couldn't find one, so I made my own! I drew on races, subraces, creature types, different terrain where people might live, different magic types, and since every game has different dieties, just one entry for 'made to honor a diety' so you can pick from your pantheon. Because, let's face it at this point, that statement is correct. Realistically what would've the NK and his army done had they reached King's Landing. They would've killed everybody or at least a decent proportion, kept the babies alive to turn into more White Walkers and afterwards would've turned all of the dead into their own. Now i don't know about you but getting stabbed or sliced and then joining the dead sounds much better than burning alive. Also there's the added bonus of zero chance. ##Episode Countdown Timer - Catch up on everybody's discussion and predictions for this episode HERE! (https://www.reddit.com/r/criticalrole/wiki/campaign2#wiki_chapter_5) ANNOUNCEMENTS: Critical Role and Talks Machina will be taking a week off on Thursday 3/28 and Tuesday 4/2 due to some cast members being out of town.

Here it is! The stamina event you all were waiting for! For those that don't have roughly 3k stamina to burn, here's a breakdown so you can pick what you want, or don't want. Shadow Fiend (https://imgur.com/a/9URNvUF) Regarding Debbie; as you collect shards through doing stages, Debbie will ask you for some shards to help her with research. If you are working toward completing the suit, you'll need to get used to telling her no and seeing her cute, grumpy face! If you accept, she will reward. </p>
