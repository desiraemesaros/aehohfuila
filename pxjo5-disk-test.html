It took longer than usual to do so, however - over 30 minutes. I went away, took a shower, and when I got back, it displayed an error message about a hard drive error (I can't remember the exact wording and won't even try; that probably was a bad idea but I didn't expect it to be this severe; I think it was something about a SMART check error). From that screen, I went into advanced diagnostics. First things first, it's and hp ProBook 4520s laptop. Last spring it gave me an warning that there was an error with the hard drive, "1720-Smart Hard drive detects imminent failure (Failing Attribute: 5)."

Hey guys, Last ditch effort to a pretty urgent problem we’re having with our Avid ISIS 5500. We have dropped frames, playback issues, and media copying issues from degraded connection and we have clients in house. We’re also keeping an eye on some drives that may be failing (everything at once, as it were). It seems as if we are stuck in Disk Test mode. We’ve had degraded connection all day, along with long Disk IO warnings in the System Director. There is a warning in the status dropdown. ‎Читайте отзывы, сравнивайте оценки покупателей, просматривайте снимки экрана и узнавайте дополнительную информацию о приложении «Blackmagic Disk Speed Test».

A drive failed (E1810 faulty disk, tried pulling it out, putting it back in, attempted rebuild, rebuild failed) so I tried putting in a spare. The spare is exactly the same model make manufacturer etc. It's picked up fine on my windows machine, I've done all the disk tests and checks I can do including full read write tests, also run a handful of tests on linux and it passes fine - no sign of anything. Download Disk Speed Test - This application will allow you to measure the speed of your input/output devices. ##The Thought: So, I have recently acquired several new servers, and am in the process of rebuilding my lab - which is going to include some 'prod' stuff, as well. One of these new servers, is a DL380 G6 with 8x 300GB 10k SAS disks. I'm not going to give away too many details about the servers - saving that for a hopefully cool reveal. Anyway, part of the plan involves turning the G6 into my block storage backend. I intend to run Linux (probably CentOS), and will be using MDADM Download Disk Test - Portable tool which enables you to test your hard drive and overwrite old data files with random data, the standard "0101" or a custom string. 
I have the mi mix 2s 128gb version and my brother got the 64gb one. We noticed today while checking things out that on passmark the disk tests on my brothers phone were about half the speed of what I got on the 128gb version. Could someone with this phone be kind to run the test on their phone and share results so we could see if you get the same results or if my brothers phone is faulty some way. Of course if there is a good reason for this and someone knows it please share.

Hi, I have at home a DS916+ with 5400 HDDs. I have a ESXi server with NFS datatore on my synology. While performance is "ok", it's not THAT great. I was wondering if changing the HDD to 7200 would change anything ? BTW, both ESXi and 916+ are connected at 1gbit speed. When I do a speed disk test with Crystalmark in a VM, it pretty much fills up the 1gb NIC in sequential tests. So, does 7200 disk would really change something since I can't get more bandwidth ? Random read/write maybe ? thank.
