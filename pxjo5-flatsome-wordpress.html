                            <p> I just got fired today, and I am trying to figure out my next move. For the past few weeks, I've been setting up an ecommerce website on landscaping products that my aunt supplies. There are already a couple of people who worked with my aunt to start their "own" ecommerce websites, but one of them "betrayed her" (not sure what that means, but it's a trivial detail I think) so she asked me to make a website just like his and beat him on pricing. I am making some progress with it: I have a Flatsom. Trying to decide between 6 premium WordPress plugins for an eCommerce store. Looking for suggestions from anyone who has experience using more than one of these.

It is an online retailing site. Message me so I can send you more information. I'd generally like to consider myself a fairly decent web developer, but this is really throwing me for a loop. I cannot, for the life of me, wrap my head around the processes necessary for achieving this layout (https://i.imgur.com/sTsn5VR.png) in wordpress, using the catalog mode in woocommerce and the flatsome theme. If anyone has any experience with creating custom product pages using the aforementioned, I would be greatly appreciative for some assistance in pointing me in the right direct. Hey Reddit, I’m currently trying to create a portfolio site for myself where I can link potential employers to. I’m an animator/digital illustrator and so I would like to have a place to put my reel and illustrations. Over the past couple of days I’ve been doing a lot of research on what platforms are out there for website development. Wordpress obviously being the one everyone seems to talk about seemed like a good fit. The problem is, I’ve never used Wordpress and I wonder if it is simple. Hello, I'm new to WordPress/WooCommerce and having a hard time really understanding some things before I get started. I'm not sure what theme would be best, and which extensions I'll need. I just heard about a theme called Flatsome that seems to be popular and looks really good. I had planned to use a theme called 'Storefront' because it says it's required to use some of the storefront extensions. Reading through Flatsome though, it seems like it might have some of those extensions already insta. 
Hello, I don't if this is right place to post this, if not, please tell me the right place. If right, please help me. Today I was working on a fresh install of WordPress website, added Flatsome theme and polylang plugin. I imported some posts, pages and menu from my another website by standard WordPress import-export tool. Everything was fine, I was going add some custom code in theme's functions.php file but noticed a big block of code, it was not from theme or any other plugin. I'm making a wordpress site for a game. The game has different scenarios people can play out and I want a page where people can search through different scenarios other people have made, as well as add their own. This is my first wordpress site and I have very little knowledge or experience with web development type things. How do I do this? If it matters I'm using the theme 'flatsome'. If there's a walkthrough, or a youtube video, that would URL: https://yournally.app/en/home/ (https://yournally.app/en/home/) Platform: Wordpress (Flatsome Theme) Feedback Requested: Roast us in general and help us to improve. \- Is it clear what the app does? \- Are you convinced or what information is missing. Hey all!

Hi, I have been looking for a plugin, license, or whatever to put onto my site, to give it a nice user friendly product customization. My wordpress site sells subscription boxes, where i would like the customer to have the option to combine the content as he or she wants. I use the theme "flatsome" with WooCommerce. I found a site called https://querohms.com/customize/all-shoes-men (https://querohms.com/customize/all-shoes-men) which have a very nice customization function. The question Does anyone have the code to add all the billing address stuff to registration (functions.php)? I have email, phone, first and last name. I need to add all the address code. I currently have this: lt?php / Flatsome functions and definitions @package flatsome / require get_template_directory()  '/inc/init.php'; function wooc_extra_register_fields() {?gt ltp class="form-row form-row-wide"gt ltlabel for=". I'm looking for examples of optimized wordpress/woocommerce websites that score well on the google PageSpeed tool: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/ The webmaster I hired to redesign my website (cuerpoymente.mx) is half-assing the optimization work and I want to show him that it's actually possible to make a fast loading and well optimized woocommerce page as this is crucial for SEO. Is anyone aware of any woocommerce websites (preferably Flatsome or Divi) that score. 📷 محتویات پکیجحقوق فروشنصب قالببروز رسانیپشتیبانیمشاوره جهت خرید120 قالب وردرپرس ترجمه شده به زبان فارسی اورجینال با ارائه مدرک خرید از تم فارست ۱۵ ساعت فیلم آموزشی نصب قالب ها و افزونه هی وردپرس 120 افزونه اورحینال و کاملا فارسی سازی شده تیم ما سعی کرده است پرفروش ترین قالب ها و افزونه های وردپرسی را انتخاب کند با یک جستجوی ساده میتوانید مشاهده کنید که تمامی محتویات این پکیج در سایت های دیگر با قیمت های بالایی به فروش می رسند آنهایی که ارزش گنجینه را میدانند برایشان تخفیف ویژه قرار دادیم. 
Hi, I want to open an e-commerge website. I want to build it in the friendliest SEO platform that exists. Unfortunately, I know only how to use Wordpress(with flatsome theme and Woocommerge plugin). But I am willing to learn a new platform if I get more benefits out of it. The website is going to be a sex shop if that matters. I heard that Prestashop beats Wordpress. Is it true? Yeah, in Wordpress you can also have a blogging category, but let's face it: blogging is not that great Hi, I have some questions and if someone is good enought to answer, I'd be grateful. I work at a sex shop and we have a wordpress website because most of orders are(or at least used to be) online. In February a guy that works here for a long time changed the theme of the website to Flatsome(I don't know what theme was before, I've been hired here since March). The website was on the first page before, now it is on fourth page and of course, the income dropped dramatically. My questions Hi! I have a Wordpress site with Woocommerce and Flatsome theme. I've never had a child theme, and am first now starting to realize I probably should have one installed. I can only find tutorials on how to do a clean install with a child theme, but is it possible to install it now somehow, without losing all customizations made to the site? And what exactly am I gonna lose? Thanks a lot, any help would be greatly appreciated. </p>
