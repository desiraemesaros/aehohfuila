Today's interview is with Andrew Moore of Felony Case (https://www.felonycase.com), a brand that sells iphone cases. Some stats: Product: iPhone cases. Revenue/mo: ,000 Started: February 2012 Location: Toronto Founders: 1 Employees: 1 ### Hello! Who are you and what business did you start? Hi, I’m Andrew Moore, the founder, and designer at Felony Case, a Toronto. Hi All, Anyone have experience with transitioning clients from a file server to sharepoint online with office 365? The company only uses word,excel and pdf and file server is 250GBs (20 years of data) so they dont do that much stuff. Just thinking of a quick and dirty solution that comes with versioning and backups without having to upgrade onsite hardware (old server is on its last legs) or going with an expensive cloud solution like egnyte). First of all, absolutely do not get overwhelmed by what I'm about to share. This is everything I've found or created myself or heard of from others and collected over 3-5 years (pre-nursing + nursing school). You don't necessarily need all of this to thrive in nursing school. Pick and choose what works for you. This is very long I know, but hopefully very worth your reading. A friend told me I had to write this up and post it, so here I am. A little context about me and my background: This is more a discussion than a question. amp#x200B; I consider myself a Windows power user. I have always been interested in Linux since 1997 (First distro I ever tried was slackware) however I never got very deep into it. Fast forward till today, it's very easy to grab a distro and run it live or installed. Beyond that, I tend to go back to Windows, cos I can't do all the things I need on Linux. Of course, enthusiasts are going to disagree cos it seems Linux is THE OS, hence my question:. # Foreword: It turns out, I'm just like my dad (damn it) and ramble on and on. I wrote a damned book. But. there were several instances where I easily would end up in a difficult situation if I'm not careful in my planning. So, I wanted especially to highlight these, as they're not the typical pitfalls someone would run into during a "normal" trip. Anyway, I hope some of it might help someone somehow. By the way, to me, "off the beaten path" just means places that are less traveled. 
Hi guys, I'm very new to VBA and could really use your help. I'm attempting to download several non-local HTTP files listed as hyperlinks in an Excel file using the code below, which I managed to get online. However, whenever I attempt to run the program, nothing happens except Excel seems to "think" for a bit and return to normal. No windows pop up, nothing. Details: \- I'm running on Windows 7 and using Excel 2010. \- The hyperlinks lead to files of varying types, including (Copied this from someone who copied it from Facebook, credit goes originally to Misty S. Boyer. Yes it's fucking long) There's a lot of news going on about the "black hole girl" right now, and how she's being given too much credit for her role in the historic first image of a black hole. Because this is too important, I want to set the record straight. Once Katie Bouman became the "face" of the black hole photo, and articles began to call her "the woman behind the black hole photo", an assort. So I haven't written a review in a long while. Before this I had owned a 2017 15" Macbook Pro with the highest specs. When deciding I had also tried a Dell XPS 15" which was a great machine but wasn't there just yet. I was on a 3 week trip to India and destroyed my k Macbook Pro thanks to a Gin and Tonic. Needing a new machine I set out to find the perfect machine for the daily driver. amp#x200B; I'm a pilot and travel the world for work. I'm currently sitting in Cabo, MX at a coffee. 
She was using Windows 7. amp#x200B; She called me to come to help because she couldn't play the movie that was on a USB stick I gave her on her computer. amp#x200B; It was in h265 and she used media player, didn't know about VLC. I could have just installed VLC, it would have got the job done, but I felt like converting her, she was on a system that won't be supported anymore in not that long, and too worried about security issues to use her credit card online. amp#x200B; 3-11-19 Hello Everyone! The Release was a tremendous success, with hundreds giving very positive feedback! Of course, as with anything, there may be a few issues to contend with, things to fix up, etc! I will take several of the suggestions, comments, messages into account! Expect another follow-up Release within a few days for some more bigger, badder, better than ever stuff for your Mini NES/SNES/PSC! Thanks again, all of you!!! And, on a special side note.Every April Fool's. Hi folks, we were giving a PDF of a completed Dpmo and were asked to replicate it on excel.Only advise we are given is to check YouTube or websites on working out to complete it. Can anyone give a recommendation of a good place to look online. I can upload the file if anyone wants to have a look, and as long as I'm not breaking any rules. 
Since there was another retrospective written up recently, figured I'd give this one a go. Overall impressions: In my opinion, a good program given the constraints of online learning. There is plenty of challenge available, and upon completion you'll be able to stand toe-to-toe with other CS programs. You'll do plenty that work you'll be proud of. It's not without its detractors, and those detractors have good justifications for feeling how they do. There are some classes in the program. 500e (2nd gen) review This is SweetTeaForMe’s 1 week review, coming from a Thinkpad T420. scroll to bottom for tl;dr or who should buy this laptop -Screen: Buying the 500e was a little scary after hearing flak from other reviewers about the odd screen ratio (1366x768) and poor quality. Personally, the screen is just fine for me. The only times I have ever felt like the screen could be better is in high light situations. Typically, it’s not a big deal, and is only a minor annoyance I found it really helpful to read through people’s experiences preparing for and taking step 1, so I wanted to contribute! I go to a top 20 medical school with a pass/fail 1.5 year preclinical curriculum. We take step 1 after our clerkship year. I had 8 weeks of dedicated. amp#x200B; Scores: UW First Pass - 85% (first pass, average remained stable throughout dedicated) NBME 15 – 255 (4 weeks out) NBME 16 – 255 (3 weeks out) NBME 19 – 248 (2.5 weeks out; decided to take this before. Hi everyone! This is my first post on r/gamedev but I've been designing games for over 10 years and I've always been interested in gathering as much information as possible about game development across all the disciplines. I typically scour the GDC talks as they come onto the vault each year, but every year there is more and more places to find good talks. So, I want to know, what are some of the best talks you've found, that you would recommend for other game developers? I didn't
