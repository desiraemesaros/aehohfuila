So, last month I got punched in the face hard with writer's block. I've been trying to work past it but I've been struggling. So apologies for my total lack of output. I'm just. unhappy with what little I did make. To try and shake things up I decided to work on a side story that's been in my head for a bit. This is just to sort of see if the Material Differences World is interesting enough to support other stories. That said I'm trying to make it stand alone as well. but we'll see.

The new quests reward catapult, action report, new model aerial armament material and medal. 1.

It's been only a week since the last SotS, but given the major news from Konami recently, we felt it was best to tackle this as soon as humanly possible. I'll address the elephant in the room, and then we'll get into the important links. As you've probably heard by now, motivated by the massive financial success of Duel Links, Konami has decided to cease production of all physical cards in the TCG regions. This also includes the cancellations of all upcoming events.

I'm Kryyn Tosh on the Discord server and I'm here with a guide! Now that the 3.0 update has been around for a while, I wanted to assemble (what I hope to be) a fairly comprehensive 3.0 guide. This guide should cover everything that new players need to know now that the 3.0 update has settled in; it will also help returning players get up to speed on everything that’s new in 3.0. For new players: rejoice! Progression is much smoother, less RNG-based, and overall cleaner 
Political Map of Kenshi v.3.5 (https://i.imgur.com/07W22uj.png) ( March 12, 2019 ) After suggestions regarding the Hub, the Shek Kingdom's contestation zone has been expanded to include it, complete with hashing. I've also switched its icon to the "independent city" one, given the gt!Holy Nation Outlaws!lt that actually control it. Similarly, "Spring," home of the gt!Anti-Slavers!lt has been adjusted to more accurately represent the fact this map is from the United Cities'.

This isn't my job, right here right now. Mine is elsewhere, but you, Bioware, should have people employed to make sure of a game's quality and find issues in it. Many developers don't need their hand held by a whole community when developing a game, the good ones test and balance it in house until they can say themselves that it's fun. Why do I know that? Because everywhere I've worked has had them. That process has been skipped entirely here. Bioware, your design teams have failed at every. Melvin helps the marines with a bit of hacking. \--- With the voidborne Borja threat neutralized, our two parasite carriers went about the business of retrieving their fighters. Most pilots were eager to get out of their cockpits, but protocol demanded that the fighter corps maintain an active presence while there were active Borja threats in the system. Abwell was asking for volunteers. Seeing an easy way to earn some good will with the squadron, I volunteered. Talon 4 also volunteered. 
If you're at all familiar with the Pokemon anime, then you probably know that Ash nearly beat Brock in his first gym battle after Onix was soaked by the sprinklers, letting Pikachu's electricity hurt him. (https://gfycat.com/HarmoniousOrnateAmericanindianhorse) For many this was written off as just the first of many examples of the anime completely ignoring game mechanics. But when Gen 5 rolled around, an interesting fan theory came around. Some posited that this was not just bullshit anime. This is not a guide or walkthrough.

Since Ember and Vauban was brought up in Mogamu's Dev-intreview (Link) (https://youtu.be/5RtZpt9E7WE?t=896) i thought i'd share my thoughts on ember since she's a warframe i'm quite fond of. so firstly i want to adress the general feedback regarding ember, that the community has been pushing. A lot of people want to see her just get reverted, which won't actually fix the fundamental problem with ember, which is that she doesn't scale well into end game. While i do agree that the "rework". A tradition of mine is to try to complete the game on Ace Difficulty while only using what canonically the player's pilot seems to have access to, cockpit only. However, I don't have a good feel for a few things for Trigger, our character in Ace Combat 7: The only thing I feel mostly sure on is that Trigger flies a F-16C Fighting Falcon as Mage 2. According to the Acepedia wiki, he also seems to fly the F-15C Eagle and the F-22A Raptor. However, I'm doubtful he'd be allowed those aircraft.

Many of the guides are great, and it's wonderful that there are many people here who are willing to share their advice and theorycraft (lots of games don't have players this selfless). But it also seems like many of the guides are written in retrospect, with upgraded heroes, artifacts, items. 
Ok. I have looked at so many pictures, read a lot, and still so many people wonder how the tech actually works. So I'll give my theory: amp#x200B; A suit is basically just that. A shell, that has a hollow inside, and is consisting of several parts, the limbs in particular, the head, and the torso and hip sections. That inside, is filled with an "endo skeleton". You can see something very interesting in some cases: Scrap Baby (https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/freddy-fazbears-pizzeria. The Squadron attends a briefing for a dangerous raid into Borja territory. \--- The Shield of Kalador returned to home fleet with little fanfare. Unlike the Light of Esha who was low on Jump fuel from its long patrol, the Shield of Kalador had enough reserves to make the micro jumps to reunite with the Home Fleet.
